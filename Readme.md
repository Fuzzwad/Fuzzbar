# Fuzzbar

Fuzzbar is a hecking taskbar in rainmeter, made to entirely replace the stock windows taskbar. It's built entirely off Mr. Ashtefere's (jonseppanen) skeleton. As of right now it's still pretty much a skeleton. But stuff is getting added, I swear.

### Let me tell you it's features!

  - Task activate/minimize by click
  - Get all the information about tasks and export to measures (use rainmeter about to see the information)
  - Extract icons from Tasks and save them to the Documents\raintaskbar dir
  - Extract dominant color from icons for use later
  - Start Button Example
  - A variable (activetasknumber) is saved in rainmeter to indicate which task number is actually active

### Coming features

 - Systray (Temporarily removed as of now)
 - A SysInfo area where you can slip between CPU/GPU usages, Time/Date, Current song, and some other stuff I haven't thought of yet.
