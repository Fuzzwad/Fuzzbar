# RainTaskbar

RainTaskbar is exactly what it sounds like. It's a god damned taskbar for rainmeter.
Well, it's a skeleton of one. I built this repo so you can make your own taskbar rainmeter skins.

### Let me tell you it's features!

  - Task activate/minimize by click
  - Get all the information about tasks and export to measures (use rainmeter about to see the information)
  - Extract icons from Tasks and save them to the Documents\raintaskbar dir
  - Extract dominant color from icons for use later

### Coming features

 - Systray (have the code, just need to throw it in)
 - Right Click function
 - Middle Click function

Take a look at how this demo skin is built to understand what's going on.
Any bugs, hit me up on github.
